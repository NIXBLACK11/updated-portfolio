                In 2021, I took the plunge into software development while pursuing my Bachelor's in <a className="font-custom font-color">Computer Science and Engineering</a>.Since then, I've had the opportunity to work on diverse projects, from contributing to open-source initiatives at <a className="font-custom font-color">Meta</a> to founding <a className="font-custom font-color">Solabule</a>, a decentralized gaming platform on Solana.

                Currently, my focus is on creating innovative software solutions that blend functionality with user-friendly design. I thrive on building applications that not only perform seamlessly but also provide an enjoyable user experience. I'm passionate about leveraging my skills in <a className="font-custom font-color">Golang</a>, <a className="font-custom font-color">TypeScript,</a>, and <a className="font-custom font-color">Web3,</a> to drive meaningful projects forward.

                When Iâ€™m not coding, you can find me playing video games, enjoying football, or hiking in the great outdoors.
